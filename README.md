# MongoDB Chatbot Framework

The MongoDB Chatbot Framework is a set of libraries that you can use to build
full-stack intelligent chatbot applications using MongoDB and [Atlas Vector Search](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/).
The MongoDB Chatbot Framework includes first class support for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

You can use the framework to take your application from prototype to production.
You can quickly build a prototype using the framework to get an AI chatbot powered by MongoDB up and running. You can then use the framework's extensible interfaces to scale your chatbot to production with features like evaluation, complex prompting strategies, and support for multiple AI models.

## Documentation

To learn how to use the MongoDB Chatbot Framework, refer to the documentation:
<https://mongodb.github.io/chatbot/>.

## MongoDB Docs AI Chatbot Implementation

This repo also contains the implementation of the MongoDB Docs Chatbot,
which uses the MongoDB Chatbot Framework.

The MongoDB Docs Chatbot uses the MongoDB [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) and [Developer Center](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/) as its sources of truth.

The chatbot builds on the following technologies:

- Atlas Vector Search: Indexes and queries content for use in project.
- MongoDB Atlas: Persists conversations and content.
- ChatGPT API: LLM to pre-process user queries and summarize responses to user queries.
- OpenAI Embeddings API: Create vector embeddings for user queries and content. Used by Atlas Vector Search.

To learn more about how we built the chatbot, check out the MongoDB Developer Center blog post
[Taking RAG to Production with the MongoDB Documentation AI Chatbot](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/taking-rag-to-production-documentation-ai-chatbot/).
