# MongoDB Knowledge Service

The MongoDB Knowledge Service lets you learn about MongoDB using generative AI.

## Responses API

To build MongoDB-related conversational AI applications, use the [Responses API](./server/responses-api.md). The Responses API is compatible with the OpenAI API and provides MongoDB-specific knowledge through retrieval-augmented generation.
 
## Server OpenAPI Specification

To call the MongoDB Knowledge Service API, refer to the [OpenAPI specification](/server/openapi/).

## UI Library

You can call the MongoDB Knowledge Service API from a web application using the `mongodb-chatbot-ui` npm package. The UI library provides a React component that you can use to build a chat interface. Learn more in the [UI documentation](./ui.md).
