    The MongoDB RAG Server API is a RESTful API that allows you to
    create and manage conversations.
    The API is designed to be used by the MongoDB RAG UI frontend,
    but can also be used by other clients.

    **NOTE:** The default configuration requires capturing user IP address
    and a header `Origin: some_string`. You can override this.
    Refer to the server configuration documentation for more information.
