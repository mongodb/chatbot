    The MongoDB RAG Server API is a RESTful API that allows you to
    create and manage conversations.
    The API is designed to be used by the MongoDB RAG UI frontend,
    but can also be used by other clients.

    **NOTE:** The default configuration requires capturing user IP address
    and a header `Origin: some_string`. You can override this.
    Refer to the server configuration documentation for more information.

            If you set the query parameter `?stream=false`, the server responds with `application/json`.

            If you set the query parameter `?stream=true`, the server responds with `text/event-stream`. The server returns a [server-sent event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format) stream.
            (Note that the server does not use [named events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#named_events).)
            The below schema for `text/event-stream` corresponds to contents of the event's `data` field. For example:

            ```txt
            data: {"type": "delta", "data": "Starting "}

            data: {"type": "delta", "data": "to "}

            data: {"type": "delta", "data": "stream "}

            data: {"type": "references", "data": [{"url": "https://mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started", "title": "Get Started with MongoDB Atlas"}]}
