# Galileo Evaluation Platform Code

We're assessing the Galileo evaluation platform ([rungalileo.io](https://www.rungalileo.io/)). Currently, their evaluation library is much more robust in Python than in JavaScript/TypeScript, so I am creating a separate Python project to evaluate Galileo.

## Run Code

All code is in the Jupyter notebooks in this directory.
