# Certification Program Guide

## Introduction

This program guide was created to provide details about our certification program. Our hope is that you will use this guide to familiarize yourself with our collection of exams, the vendors we partner with, our testing process, and the policies and guidelines we expect our testers to follow.

## Why Certify?

Certifications oered by MongoDB are recognized by professional institutions and the worldwide tech community, as representing a mastery level in MongoDB applications.

## Value

Certifications validate tester's knowledge and skills through examination. MongoDB Certified Professionals are employed at organizations of all sizes, in 196+ countries.

Companies hiring certified professionals benefit by having a third-party validate a tester's knowledge, skills and abilities, leading to a better industry reputation, higher-quality work and, ultimately, more customers.

- 91% of hiring managers report certification is an important criterion for hiring. 1
- Certification makes job candidates stand out in a crowded job market. 2
- Certification makes a better case for that big raise or promotion.3
- Third-party validation of skills is far more powerful than self-promotion of
  knowledge.

- Gain job proficiency more quickly (via exam preparation)
- Show commitment by investing in your career

It's your choice to follow these recommendations or not.

## The Testing Experience

MongoDB has partnered with a few companies to curate a straightforward yet secure testing experience.

### Registration

The certification journey begins on our training portal MongoDB University. Simply select the certification of your choice from the certification page, register, complete the transaction process, and you're on your way!

### Scheduling

Once you've registered and completed the transaction process, you'll be sent to our online proctoring partner, Examity, to complete your tester profile and schedule your exam. Online proctoring means that exams can be taken right from your computer at a time and location that is convenient for you without requiring travel to a test center. Extended Time Exams Available Upon Request: If you have a disability and/or English is not your first language, we oer extended time versions of all of our exams upon request. Once you schedule your exam, please request extended time by sending your request to certification@mongodb.com. We require 72 hrs of advanced notice for extended time requests so we can make sure the proper arrangements are made.

### Testing

On test day simply login to our training portal MongoDB University and navigate to the certification on your student dashboard to launch your exam. A system check will be initiated and you will be connected with your online proctor to begin the identification process and start your exam.

### Online Proctoring Set-up

Online proctoring means there will be someone observing you through your computer camera as you test. You may use a PC or a Mac, a desktop or a laptop but you must use a Chrome browser. Examity requires a Chrome browser extension that will be removed automatically when you complete your exam. We strongly recommend you test on a personal computer as many companies restrict adding browser extensions.

To ensure things go smoothly on test day, please turn o your pop-up blockers and run a systems test a few days in advance of your exam. Refer to the Examity Live Proctoring Test Taker Guide to make sure you're ready!

### Results and Scoring

MongoDB Certification exams have a pass/fail grading system that is determined through statistical analysis performed by psychometricians. Candidates must meet a required percentage to pass an exam. MongoDB does not publish the required percentages for our certifications as each exam passing score is determined by unique exam-specific statistical data. Candidates only need to obtain an overall required percentage to pass an exam and do not need to obtain a passing percentage for each specific domain.

Each domain has a specific weighting on the exam, which is shared in percentages within each Exam Study Guide. Domain weightings are determined by a panel of Subject Matter Experts who contributed to the development of the certification. Some domains can have more or less exam questions than others depending on the analysis of knowledge and skills required to show competency during the Job Task Analysis for the certification.

Upon completion of an exam, candidates will receive a score report that states whether they passed or failed the exam, in addition to the total percentage correct for each domain. The purpose of the score report is to provide candidates with data behind their strengths and where improvements can be made in their performance.

Candidates will receive one point for each scored exam question that is answered correctly. Periodically there are extra exam questions called unscored exam questions that do not impact your score. MongoDB field tests potential new exam questions and analyzes their statistical performance before determining if they should be used as scored exam questions on a future exam. The unscored items are not identified to avoid bias.

### Digital Credentials

Upon successful completion of a MongoDB certification exam, digital credentials and a certificate will be issued to you by our credentialing partner Credly. These assets are designed for sharing on social media tools to help you get noticed! When you accept your badge you will be searchable in the MongoDB Talent Directory which will expose your skills to talent seekers and help you connect with opportunities. Please note: Although you are provided with an immediate pass/fail result upon completion of the exam, our proctoring vendor, Examity, requires 72 hours to conduct a review of your testing session before your digital badge is released.

## Program Guidelines

### Certification Exam Terms & Conditions

The MongoDB Certification Exam Terms and Conditions describes the terms and conditions that govern your participation in our program. It is critical that you read the agreement in advance of purchasing an exam, as you will not be permitted to purchase any MongoDB exam without agreeing to these terms. Violation of any terms in the agreement can prohibit you from taking the exam, invalidate your score, suspend or revoke your certification, or ban you from the program.

### Refunds, Cancellations, and Reschedules

You may cancel or reschedule your exam anytime before your scheduled test without penalty. If you miss your scheduled test time, rescheduling will no longer be an option and a refund will not be provided.

### Retake Policy

MongoDB requires a 15-day "cooling o" period between exam retakes to limit exposure to our test forms. Our testing vendor's scheduling system will account for this 15-day period automatically and allow retake dates to be scheduled after the cooling period has been met. Retakes are the same price as the retail exams and are purchased the same way.

### Test Taking Rules

- You are not allowed to talk or read aloud during the exam.
