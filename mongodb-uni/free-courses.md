## Learning Paths

[MongoDB University](https://learn.mongodb.com/) offers multiple learning paths to suit you. All of these learning paths align to certification exams or learning badges that you can take to demonstrate your knowledge. These are just general guidelines if you don't know where to start.

- If you are a developer, you will probably want to start with the
  [developer path](https://learn.mongodb.com/pages/mongodb-developer-learning-paths).

- If you are a DBA, you will more likely prefer the [DBA path](https://learn.mongodb.com/learn/learning-path/mongodb-database-admin-self-managed-path).

- If you are an Atlas Administrator or DBA working on Atlas, you could use the [MongoDB Atlas Administrator Learning Path](https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/mongodb-atlas-administrator-path) to upskill on MongoDB Atlas.

- If you are involved in modeling your data in MongoDB or planning for a brand new application, you could take the [MongoDB Data Modeling Path](https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/data-modeling-for-mongodb) to learn the foundational steps of creating an effective data model in Mongodb.

- And, if you're working with GenAI applications we have two brand new learning paths for you! [The Building GenAI Apps Learning Badge Path](https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/building-genai-apps-learning-badge-path) will teach you the foundations of GenAI and will guide you to create your own chatbot with a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application. [The Deploying and Evaluating GenAI Apps Learning Badge Path](https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/deploying-and-evaluating-genai-apps-learning-badge-path) will teach you how to take your GenAI app to the next level and constantly improve it.
