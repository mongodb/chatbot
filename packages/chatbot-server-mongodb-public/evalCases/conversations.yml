        workloads. It is the fastest growing product in our portfolio and

        a database, but a whole data platform that includes a range of
        capabilities to simplify application architecture for developers. For
        more information on Atlas SQL commands, you can refer to the Atlas SQL

      role: user
    - content:
        Sorry, I don't know how to help with that. However, I can tell you that
        Elasticsearch is not necessarily a better alternative to MongoDB, but
        rather a different tool with a different purpose. While MongoDB is a
        general-purpose database that can store and query structured and
        unstructured data, Elasticsearch is a search engine that is optimized
        for full-text search and analytics. Elasticsearch is often used in
        conjunction with MongoDB to provide advanced search capabilities on top
        of MongoDB's data storage and retrieval capabilities.
      role: assistant
    - content: Explain how for some scenarios mongodb alone cannot match elastic search
      role: user
    - content:
        While MongoDB is a powerful and flexible document database that can
        handle a wide range of use cases, there are certain scenarios where it
        may not be the best fit. One such scenario is when you need to perform
        complex full-text search and analytics on your data. While MongoDB does
        have some basic text search capabilities, it is not optimized for this
        type of workload. In contrast, Elasticsearch is a search engine that is
        specifically designed for full-text search and analytics, and can
        provide much faster and more powerful search capabilities than MongoDB
        alone. Therefore, if you have a use case that requires advanced search
        and analytics capabilities, it may be worth considering using
        Elasticsearch in conjunction with MongoDB to provide the best of both
        worlds.

    - overview
  reference: |
    The Atlas Architecture Center is a set of guidance on how to build a robust data platform in MongoDB's Atlas. This guidance draws from real-world best practices adopted by hundreds of large enterprises running MongoDB Atlas in production.
    The recommendations provide the exact configurations you should use to optimize governance, security, automation, and more.
    The recommendations are divided into the categorires of Operational Efficiency, Security, Reliability, Performance, and Cost Optimization.
    Operational Efficiency covers the topics of automation, monitoring, and observability. Security covers the topics of network settings, of access control, and related recommendations around how to safeguard data integrity and privacy. Reliability covers the topics of hgh availability, of backups, and related recommendations to minimize downtime and prevent data loss. Performance covers the topics of built-in vertical and horizontal scaling to meet increased demand without over-provisioning. Cost Optimization covers the topics of visibility and of cost management while maintaining performance.
