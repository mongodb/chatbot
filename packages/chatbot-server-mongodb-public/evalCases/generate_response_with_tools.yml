      About Atlas Data Federation
      Atlas Data Federation is a distributed query engine that allows you to natively query, transform, and move data across various sources inside & outside of MongoDB Atlas.

      Key Concepts
      Data Federation
      Data Federation is a strategy that separates compute from storage. When you use Data Federation, you associate data from multiple physical sources into a single virtual source of data for your applications. This enables you to query your data from a single endpoint without physically copying or moving it.

      Federated Database Instance
      A federated database instance is a deployment of Atlas Data Federation. Each federated database instance contains virtual databases and collections that map to data in your data stores.

      Run a Sample Query
      After retrieving the connection string for your MongoDB Atlas deployment, you can connect to the deployment from your Java application and query the Atlas sample datasets.

      Create your Java application file
      In your project's base package directory, create a file called QuickStart.java. Copy and paste the following code into this file, which queries the movies collection in the sample_mflix database:

      public class QuickStart {
          public static void main( String[] args ) {
              // Replace the placeholder with your MongoDB deployment's connection string
              String uri = "<connection string uri>";
              try (MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(uri)) {
                  MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("sample_mflix");
                  MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("movies");
                  Document doc = collection.find(eq("title", "Back to the Future")).first();
                  if (doc != null) {
                      System.out.println(doc.toJson());
                  } else {

      Improve Accuracy
      To improve the accuracy of your search results, you can use Atlas Search support for the following features.

      Customize the Score
      Atlas Search assigns a score to every document in the result set based on relevance and returns the results in order from highest to the lowest score. To learn more, see Score the Documents in the Results.
      When you run your Atlas Search query, you can tune the relevance of the documents in the results to ensure that the most pertinent documents are ranked and returned higher in the results.
      To learn more, see How to Customize the Score of the Documents in the Results.

      Hybrid Search
      Hybrid search combines full-text search and semantic search to ensure synonymous and contextually similar matches are included in the combined results of both search methods for the same criteria in the same query.
      To learn more, see How to Perform Hybrid Search.

      Explain Your Search
      MongoDB explain provides information about how queries execute and why certain documents return over others.

      Synonyms Search
      Synonyms search ensures that your query results contain relevant results even when the exact keywords aren't present in the documents that you search.
    findContentReturnContent: |
      Full-text and vector search in a single query: You can combine results from different search methods, such as a semantic and a full-text search. You can use the $vectorSearch for the semantic search and the $search for the full-text search results and combine the results by using the reciprocal rank fusion technique.

      Overview
      Indexes are data structures that support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. They contain copies of parts of the data in documents to make queries more efficient.

      Single Field Indexes
      The following example uses the createIndex() method to create an ascending order index on the title field in the movies collection in the sample_mflix datab

      const result = await movies.createIndex({ title: 1 });
      console.log(`Index created: ${result}`);

      Compound Indexes
      The following example uses the createIndex() method to create a compound index on the type and genre fields in the movies collection in the sample_mflix database.

      const result = await movies.createIndex({ type: 1, genre: 1 });
      console.log(`Index created: ${result}`);

Use custom roles to specify custom sets of actions that the MongoDB\n      Cloud built-in roles can't describe. You define custom roles at the\n      project level, for all clusters in the project. This resource supports a\n      subset of MongoDB privilege actions. You can create a subset of custom\n      role actions. To create a wider list of custom role actions, use the\n      MongoDB Cloud user interface. Custom roles must include actions that all\n      project's clusters support, and that are compatible with each MongoDB\n      version that your project's clusters use. For example, if your project has\n      MongoDB 4.2 clusters, you can't create custom roles that use actions\n      introduced in MongoDB 4.4.\n    name: Custom Database Roles\n  - description: Returns, adds, edits, and removes Federated Database Instances.\n      This resource requires your project ID.

Each collection in a Global Cluster is associated with a\n      managed namespace. When you create a managed namespace for a Global\n      Cluster, MongoDB Cloud creates an empty collection for that namespace.\n      Creating a managed namespace doesn't populate a collection with data.\n      Similarly, deleting a managed namespace doesn't delete the associated\n      collection.\n      MongoDB Cloud shards the empty collection using the required location\n      field and a custom shard key. For example, if your custom shard key is\n      `city`, the compound shard key is `location, city`. Each Global Cluster is\n      also associated with one or more Global Writes Zones. When a user creates\n      a Global Cluster, MongoDB Cloud automatically maps each location code to\n      the closest geographical zone. Custom zone mappings allow administrators\n      to override these automatic mappings. For example, a use case might\n      require mapping a location code to a geographically distant zone.\n      Administrators can manage custom zone mappings with the APIs below and the\n      **Global Cluster Configuration** pane when you create or modify your\n      Global Cluster.\n    name: Global Clusters\n  - description: Returns invoices.\n    name: Invoices\n  - description: Returns, edits, verifies, and removes LDAP configurations. An LDAP\n      configuration defines settings for MongoDB Cloud to connect to your LDAP\n      server over TLS for user authentication and authorization. Your LDAP\n      server must be visible to the internet or connected to your MongoDB Cloud\n      cluster with VPC Peering. Also, your LDAP server must use TLS. You must\n      have the MongoDB Cloud admin user privilege to use these endpoints. Also,\n      to configure user authentication and authorization with LDAPS, your\n      cluster must run MongoDB 3.6 or higher. Groups for which you have\n      configured LDAPS can't create a cluster using a version of MongoDB 3.6 or\n      lower.\n    name: LDAP Configuration\n  - description: Manages Legacy Backup snapshots, restore jobs, schedules and checkpoints.\n    name: Legacy Backup\n  - description: Returns, edits, and removes maintenance windows.
