  reference: MongoDB skills represent the knowledge and ability to work with MongoDB.
    This includes topics like data modeling, aggregation, performance, and more.
    MongoDB Skill Badges are free, focused credentials designed to help you quickly
    learn and validate specific MongoDB skills. Each skill badge takes roughly 60-90
    minutes to earn, including videos and hands-on labs followed by a short assessment
    to verify your mastery.

    you how to structure data in the document model. It covers the three
    most common schema design patterns, specifically the inheritance pattern,
    the computed pattern, and the extended reference pattern. You will learn when

    The "MongoDB Schema Design Patterns and Antipatterns" skill teaches you
    about patterns to avoid when modeling your data for the document model.
    You will learn how to identify and avoid antipatterns such as unbounded
    arrays and bloated documents in your schema design. 

    The "MongoDB Advanced Schema Design Patterns and Antipatterns" skill teaches
    you about more complex antipatterns such as massive number of collections,
    unnecessary indexes, data normalization, and case sensitivity. This category of
    antipattern is classified as "advanced" because you must do more than analyze
    your schema to identify their performance impacts.

      content: What is the easiest way to learn MongoDB?
  reference: >
    The easiest way to learn MongoDB is to take one of our database skills
    offerings. These are short courses focused on a single topic that last no
    more than 90 minutes from start to finish and award you a digital badge
    upon completion of an assessment. If you are new to MongoDB we recommend
    starting with the "Relational to Document Model" skill. You can see the full
    list of skills at https://learn.mongodb.com/skills.
    
    If you prefer a complete, in-depth course format, we recommend taking our
    12 hour course "Introduction to MongoDB" which you can find at
    https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/introduction-to-mongodb. It gives
    a broad and rounded introduction. The difference in learning between a skill
    and a course is the time commitment, courses are longer whilst skills are
    designed to be finished end to end in 90 minutes or less.

    The primary difference between a skill and a course is the time commitment.
    Courses are longer and more hands-on whilst skills are designed to be finished end
    to end in 90 minutes or less.

    Each skill provides a digital badge on completion, courses do not. The breadth and
    depth of content in a skill is typically shallower than a course covering the same
    topics.

      content: What should I take to learn about genAI?
  reference: >-
    To learn about Generative AI (GenAI) with MongoDB, you can pursue the following
    learning paths and badges offered by MongoDB University: For a quick introduction
    to GenAI, you can start with the "Gen AI" skills. There are short courses on
    Vector Search Fundamentals and RAG with MongoDB that will provides a foundational
    understanding of GenAI concepts and how they can be applied using MongoDB technologies.
    For a more comprehensive learning experience, you can follow the two learning paths
    designed specifically for building and deploying GenAI applications:
    1. Building GenAI Apps Learning Badge Path: This path will guide you through the
    foundations of building a GenAI application using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search.
    You'll learn about semantic search and how to build chatbots with retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG) using MongoDB and Langchain.
    2. Deploying and Evaluating GenAI Apps Learning Badge Path: This path focuses on
    taking your GenAI application from creation to full deployment, optimizing performance,
    and evaluating results. It covers chunking strategies, performance evaluation techniques,
    and deployment options in MongoDB for both prototyping and production stages.
