  reference: MongoDB skills represent the knowledge and ability to work with MongoDB.
    This includes topics like data modeling, aggregation, performance, and more.
    MongoDB Skill Badges are free, focused credentials designed to help you quickly
    learn and validate specific MongoDB skills. Each skill badge takes roughly 60-90
    minutes to earn, including videos and hands-on labs followed by a short assessment
    to verify your mastery.

  reference: MongoDB offers a range of Skill Badges that you can explore on our
    skills page. Currently this includes several badges on data modeling topics and
    we're working to add more over time. We recommend starting with the "Relational
    to Document Model" skill. From there you can explore other topics like "Schema
    Design Patterns and Antipatterns", "Advanced Schema Patterns and Antipatterns",
    and "Schema Design Optimization".

  reference: The "MongoDB Schema Design Patterns and Antipatterns" skill teaches
    you how to structure data in the document model. It covers the three
    most common schema design patterns, specifically the inheritance pattern,
    the computed pattern, and the extended reference pattern. You will learn when
    and how you should apply these patterns in your data model.

  reference: >-
    The "MongoDB Schema Design Patterns and Antipatterns" skill teaches you
    about patterns to avoid when modeling your data for the document model.
    You will learn how to identify and avoid antipatterns such as unbounded
    arrays and bloated documents in your schema design. 

    The "MongoDB Advanced Schema Design Patterns and Antipatterns" skill teaches
    you about more complex antipatterns such as massive number of collections,
    unnecessary indexes, data normalization, and case sensitivity. This category of
    antipattern is classified as "advanced" because you must do more than analyze
    your schema to identify their performance impacts.

    the approximation pattern and the schema versioning pattern. You will learn
    how to identify when they are suitable and how you should apply them to your
    data model.

    recommendations on how to update the schema as well as how you can migrate
    your application to the new schema without downtime. It also covers how to
    use schema versioning to manage evolving your data model to new business
    requirements which add new fields.

  reference: The skill, "MongoDB Schema Design Optimization", teaches you how to
    optimize your existing schema. You will learn how to implement schema
    patterns (if you are not already doing so!) focused on performance
    optimization such as the single collection pattern, the subset pattern, the
    bucket pattern, and the outlier pattern. It will also teach how you can
    design your data model for performance in a sharded cluster and more broadly
    as a means to scale out your schema.

      content: What is the easiest way to learn MongoDB?
  reference: The easiest way to learn MongoDB is to take one of our database
    skills offerings. These are short lasting no more than 90 minutes from start
    to assessment which awards you a digital badge on completion. If you are new
    to MongoDB we recommend starting with our skill on "From Relational Model
    (SQL) to MongoDB's Document Model". You can see our full list of skill at
    https://learn.mongodb.com/skills Each skill is focused on one topic, if you
    want to learn MongoDB in a more complex fashion, we'd recommend taking our
    12 hour course on "Introduction to MongoDB"
    https://learn.mongodb.com/learning-paths/introduction-to-mongodb which gives
    a broad and rounded introduction. The difference in learning between a skill
    and a course is the time commitment, courses are longer whilst skills are
    designed to be finished end to end in 90 minutes or less.

    The difference in learning between a skill and a course is the time
    commitment, courses are longer whilst skills are designed to be finished end
    to end in 90 minutes or less.

    Each skill provides a digitial badge on completion, courses do not. The breath and depth of content in a skill is typically shallower than a course covering the same topics.
