name: sample_geospatial
description: The 'sample_geospatial' database is designed to store and manage
  geospatial data related to shipwrecks. It provides detailed information about
  various shipwrecks, including their location, type, and historical context.
  The database is optimized for geospatial queries, allowing users to
  efficiently search and analyze shipwreck data based on geographic coordinates.

    description: The 'shipwrecks' collection stores detailed information about
      shipwrecks, including their geographic location, type, and historical
      details. Each document in the collection represents a specific shipwreck,
      identified by its unique ID. Key fields include 'feature_type' for the
      type of wreck, 'coordinates' for geospatial data, and 'history' for
      historical context. The collection is crucial for geospatial analysis,
      with a 2dsphere index on the 'coordinates' field to support efficient
      geospatial queries. This collection serves as the primary data source for
      understanding and analyzing shipwrecks within the database.
