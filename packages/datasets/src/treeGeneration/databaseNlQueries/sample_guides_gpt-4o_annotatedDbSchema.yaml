description: The 'sample_guides' database is designed to store and manage
  information about planets in our solar system. It provides detailed data on
  each planet's characteristics, such as its position relative to the sun,
  atmospheric composition, surface temperature, and other unique identifiers.
  This database is likely used for educational purposes, research, or as a
  reference for applications related to astronomy or space exploration.

    description: The 'planets' collection stores detailed information about each
      planet in the solar system. It includes data such as the planet's name,
      its order from the sun, whether it has rings, its main atmospheric
      components, and surface temperature details. This collection serves as the
      core of the database, providing essential data for any analysis or
      application that requires planetary information. The collection is indexed
      by the unique identifier '_id', ensuring efficient data retrieval.
