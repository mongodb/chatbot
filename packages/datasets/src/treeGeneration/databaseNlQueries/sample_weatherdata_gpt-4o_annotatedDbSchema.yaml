name: sample_weatherdata
description: The 'sample_weatherdata' database is designed to store and manage
  comprehensive weather data collected from various sources. It includes
  detailed meteorological information such as temperature, pressure, wind,
  visibility, and sky conditions, along with metadata about the data collection
  process. This database is likely used for weather analysis, forecasting, and
  research purposes, providing a rich dataset for understanding atmospheric
  conditions over time and across different locations.

    description: The 'data' collection is the core component of the
      'sample_weatherdata' database, storing detailed weather observations. Each
      document in this collection represents a weather data point, including
      attributes like air temperature, dew point, pressure, wind conditions,
      visibility, and sky conditions. The collection also includes metadata such
      as the data source, quality control process, and geographical position of
      the observation. This collection serves as the primary repository of
      weather data, supporting analysis and research activities. It does not
      explicitly reference other collections, indicating it may function
      independently within the database.
