  The MongoDB Atlas CLI (Command Line Interface) allows you to manage MongoDB
  Atlas resources directly from the command line.

  It includes intuitive commands for interacting with your Atlas database
  deployments and Atlas Search from the terminal. You can use the CLI to
  accomplish complex database management tasks. It allows you to perform a
  variety of tasks that might otherwise be managed through the Atlas UI, for
  example:

  - creating and managing clusters, databases, and collections
  - configuring network access
  - managing backups

  The Atlas CLI is particularly useful for developers and system administrators
  who prefer working within a terminal environment or require automation
  capabilities. For example, in a DevOps context, operations like provisioning
  new databases or updating configurations can be integrated into continuous
  deployment pipelines by using the CLI.
