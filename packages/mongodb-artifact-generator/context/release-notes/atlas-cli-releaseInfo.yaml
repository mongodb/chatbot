  The MongoDB Atlas CLI (Command Line Interface) allows you to manage MongoDB
  Atlas resources directly from the command line. MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed
  cloud database service that offers MongoDB databases in the cloud, ensuring
  scalable and flexible management of databases without the need for manual
  intervention in terms of hardware and infrastructure management.

  The Atlas CLI is particularly useful for developers and system administrators
  who prefer working within a terminal environment or require automation
  capabilities. It allows users to perform a variety of tasks that would typically
  be managed through the Atlas UI, such as creating and managing database
  clusters, configuring network access, managing backups, and scaling resources
  according to demand.

  With the Atlas CLI, users can also automate repetitive tasks through scripting.
  This is especially beneficial in a DevOps context, where operations like
  provisioning new databases or updating existing configurations can be integrated
  into continuous deployment pipelines. The CLI supports multiple commands that
  mirror the functionality available in the Atlas GUI, ensuring that any task that
  can be performed in the interface can also be executed from the command line.

  Moreover, the Atlas CLI is part of MongoDB's suite of integration tools, which
  also includes APIs and other utility tools. It is designed to be intuitive for
  those familiar with command line operations, providing a seamless experience for
  managing MongoDB deployments. This tool is essential for those looking to
  leverage MongoDB Atlas's powerful features in a programmatic way that integrates
  with existing workflows and systems.
