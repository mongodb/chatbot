  Build full-stack intelligent chatbot applications using MongoDB and Atlas Vector Search.

  The MongoDB Chatbot Framework is a set of libraries that you can use to build a production-ready chatbot application. The framework provides first-class support for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and is extensible to support other patterns for building intelligent chatbots.

  The MongoDB Chatbot Framework has the following core components:

  - MongoDB Atlas: Database for the application that stores content and conversation. Indexes content using Atlas Vector Search.
  - Ingest CLI: Configurable CLI application that you can use to ingest content into a MongoDB collection for use with Atlas Vector Search.
  - Chatbot Server: Express.js server routes that you can use to build a chatbot application.
  - Chatbot UI: React.js UI components that you can use to build a chatbot application.
  - Evaluation CLI: CLI application that you can use to evaluate the performance of your chatbot and its components.
  - Artifact Generator: CLI application that you can use to create or transform artifacts like code snippets and docs pages.
