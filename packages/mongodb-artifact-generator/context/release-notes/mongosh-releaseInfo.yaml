  The MongoDB Shell, mongosh, is a JavaScript and Node.js REPL environment for
  interacting with MongoDB deployments in Atlas, locally, or on another remote
  host. Use the MongoDB Shell to test queries and interact with the data in your
  MongoDB database.

  The MongoDB Shell can perform a variety of tasks, including:

  - Connecting to MongoDB deployments
  - Creating and managing databases and collections
  - Running queries and aggregations
  - Inserting, updating, and deleting data
  - Managing database users and roles
  - Creating and managing indexes
  - Running other administrative commands

  The MongoDB Shell is particularly useful for developers and system
  administrators who prefer working within a terminal environment.
