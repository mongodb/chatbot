    ASSISTANT: PostgreSQL and MongoDB are two different types of databases. PostgreSQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL to manage and manipulate data. It is a good choice for applications that require complex queries and transactions. On the other hand, MongoDB is a NoSQL document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is a good choice for applications that require flexible and scalable data models. While both databases have their strengths and weaknesses, the choice between them ultimately depends on the specific needs of your application.`;

    - Postgres is SQL
    - MongoDB is document-based and NoSQL`;

  });
  test("should identify when MongoDB chatbot answer is incorrect", async () => {
    const conversation = stripIndents`USER: What is the $lookup aggregation operator for MongoDB?
    ASSISTANT: One way to look up data in MongoDB is by using a find operation such as the \`find()\` or \`findOne()\` methods. These methods allow you to request results based on a set of criteria from the existing set of data. You can also further specify the information you are requesting by including additional parameters or by chaining other methods such as sorting, skipping, limiting, or specifying which fields to return. Another way to look up data is by using an aggregation operation, which allows you to apply an ordered pipeline of transformations to the matched data. Additionally, you can use the watch operation to monitor the database for incoming data that matches a set of criteria and be notified in real-time when matching data is inserted.`;
