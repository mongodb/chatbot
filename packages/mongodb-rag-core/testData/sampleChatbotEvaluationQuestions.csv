https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/ ","MongoDB is a document database designed for ease of application development and scaling. You can store hierarchical structured data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects. MongoDB is available in different environments, including MongoDB Atlas (a fully managed service in the cloud), MongoDB Enterprise (a subscription-based, self-managed version), and MongoDB Community (a free-to-use, self-managed version). It is popular among development teams that use agile methodologies due to its flexible schema approach. Let me know if you have any more questions!",12/13/2024,example
How does MongoDB help with AI projects?,Bill Mitchell,https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search,"MongoDB will help you build intelligent applications powered by semantic search and generative AI using native, full-featured vector database capabilities. Generative AI uses vectors to enable intelligent semantic search over unstructured data (text, images, and audio). Vectors are critical in building recommendation engines, anomaly detection, and conversational AI. MongoDB Atlas integrates operational and vector data in a single, unified platform. With Atlas Vector Search built into the core database, there’s no need to sync data between your operational and vector databases—saving time, reducing complexity, and preventing errors. Your operational and vector data stay in one place.",1/13/2025,
what's better about your latest (or 8.0) release?,Bill Mitchell,https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/top-4-reasons-to-use-mongodb-8-0,"MongoDB 8.0 is the latest release and it's over 30% faster than before. It is more secure with MongoDB Quaryable Encription, which allows  customers to encrypt sensitive data on the client side, store it securely as fully randomized encrypted data in the MongoDB database, and to run expressive queries on the encrypted data for processing. MongoDB 8.0 makes it cheaper and easier to scale with horizontal scaling, applications can scale beyond the limits of traditional database resources by splitting data across multiple servers.  And MongoDB 8.0 provides greater control for teams optimizing database performance for unpredictable spikes in usage and sustained periods of high demand. ",1/13/2025,
